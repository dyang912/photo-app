<!--  How you would add a feature so users can easily add alt-text to their images?
I would like to add a double click event for all pictures. This event will start an animation that flips the pictures
and then show the alt-text or "no alt-text" and an edit button. User can easily find the entrance of adding alt-text.
I will also add this to the "help" page.
