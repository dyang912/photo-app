1. What corrections did you have to make?
A: I changed the alt text for the picture and make it different from each other. It helps users understand the page
better if they cannot fetch the picture successfully. I also changed some text colors to fix the low contrast problem.

2. Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, do you think that the accessibility problems
are all solvable? Why or why not?
A: No. In this situation, it is hard to fix visual problems like the unmatched color/low contrast. These problems
will affect the accessibility and user experience a lot.

3. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
A: No. When I turn off the CSS, the page looks like pictures and texts are placed randomly. It is hard to get some
useful information.

4. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not?
A: Yes. It is because users can read captions and the alt text for pictures to get the general ideas. The picture is not
required in this scenario.
